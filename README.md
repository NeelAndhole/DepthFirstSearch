# DepthFirstSearch
An asymptotically optimal implementation of a depth first search. 
The input: the first line contains an integer t, indicating the number of instances that follows. For each instance, the first line contains an integer n, indicating the number of nodes in the graph. Each of the following n lines contains several space-separated strings, where the first string s represents the name of a node, and the following strings represent the names of nodes that are adjacent to node s. The order of the nodes in the adjacency list is important, as it will be used as the tie-breaker
